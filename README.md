## About

This application demonstrates 6 different image processing filters created using the p5.js library. Filters can be switched using keyboard inputs 1 to 6. These are the filters implemented:

1. Early bird filter: Adds sepia tone, dark corners, radial blur, and border effects with a default focus on the boy's face. The focus on the filtered image can be adjusted by clicking anywhere on the original image.

2. Invert filter: Inverts the colors of the image.

3. Grayscale filter: Converts the image to grayscale.

4. Threshold filter: Converts the image to black and white based on a threshold value adjustable via the slider.

5. Edge detection filter: Detects edges in the image using convolution matrices.

6. Sharpen filter: Sharpens the image using a convolution matrix.
